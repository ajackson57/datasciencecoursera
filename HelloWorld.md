### This what I did for The Data Scientists Toolbox project
* Opened RStudio and captured an image of it
* Created a Repo (datasciencecoursera) in Git Hub and captured a link to it (https://github.com/ajackson57/datasciencecoursera)
* Created this file and added it to the Repo created in the previous step
* Forked a datasharing Repo (https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) and captured a link to it
